# Game Projects!

A list of ideas for game projects I have had! some sfw and some nsfw **wink**

## SFW

Safe For Work games!

### Text based game

This is a text based game, where you have to type what you'd want to do!

### Game Engine

I'm going to use GoDot since it has a code that is close to Python, to get me used to coding.

### Story

This is the *nsfw* version of the Text Based Game I had an idea for! I might need to use help from friends/ai etc. to hlep describe the ideas/scenes that I will use!

### Game Engine

I'm going to use GoDot since it has a code that is close to Python, to get me used to coding.

### Game System

Maybe it will be a battle system, or it will be an interactive story that I will do. 

* Battle system is using Hp and etc, maybe skill points?
* Interactive story, you get to descide how the scene plays, which position etc. It will use skills etc, to determine how long you last etc.
    - Stamina, determins how long you last
    - How "erect" you can be, changes dialog etc.
